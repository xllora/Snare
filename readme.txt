Snare is a coordination layer for distributed applications written in Scala.
Snare implements a basic heartbeat system and a simple notification mechanism.
Snare relies on MongoDB (http://www.mongodb.org/) to track heartbeat and
notification mailboxs.

In order to run this code and the tests you will need to have an instance of
MongoDB up and running before attempting to run the code or tests.
